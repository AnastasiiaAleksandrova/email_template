<h1>HTML email template</h1>

<h2>Tested on</h2>
Gmail <br>
Mail (OSX) <br>
Outlook <br>
IOS (Chrome emulator) <br>

<h2>Main principles applied</h2>
Inline styles <br>
Tables for layout <br>
Images instead of icon fonts <br>
Px for sizing <br>
Avoiding margins and paddings <br>
Including the dimensions of images <br>
Using HTML attribute instead of CSS <br>

<h2>Notes</h2>
The template could be done in more strict way: using td and tr instead of p and br. However I tryed to keep code clear and readable as well as maintain correct rendering in listed clients. <br>
I did not figure out exact fonts and used those that seemed closer match. <br>
Icons and images were mostly cut from the mockup. <br>
I decided to add media query for small screens to maintain accessibility though it affected the design. <br>
