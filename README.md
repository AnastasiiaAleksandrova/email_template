<h1>HTML email template</h1>

<h2>Tested on</h2>
Gmail
Mail (OSX)
Outlook
IOS (Chrome emulator)

<h2>Main principles applied</h2>
Inline styles
Tables for layout
Images instead of icon fonts
Px for sizing
Avoiding margins and paddings
Including the dimensions of images
Using HTML attribute instead of CSS

<h2>Notes</h2>
The template could be done in more strict way: using td and tr instead of p and br. However I tryed to keep code clear and readable as well as maintain correct rendering in listed clients.
I did not figure out exact fonts and used those that seemed closer match.
Icons and images were mostly cut from the mockup.
I decided to add media query for small screens to maintain accessibility though it affected the design.
